<p style="text-align: left;">During the test phase, a cell assembly (CA) for each of the 60 instances will emerge. CA is a composition of neurons that are activated in response to the corresponding grounding pattern inputted to the extra-sylvian primary areas *V1 and *M1L. We will analyze the unique and overlapping structure among CAs that were activated by training instances of the same category. For each model area, neurons will be classified according to whether they were activated by just 1 grounding patterns or whether they responded to 2 or 3, thus being part of the pair or triple-wise shared overlap of grounding CAs. Successful category learning of the model could be indicated by a higher proportion of neurons shared by all three training instances.</p>
