<h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>The Influence of Category Label vs. Proper Name on Conceptual Representation</strong></h2>

<br>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is suggested that applying consistent categorical labels facilitates the encoding of commonalities among instances of the same category, while applying proper names on each instance increases the encoding of unique features from these instances. By training a neurobiologically highly realistic deep neural network with spiking neurons and brain-like connectivity on instances from the same category across two conditions (Proper Name and Category Label), the current project aims to understand the neural and cognitive basis of proper names and category labels. In other words, we investigate how proper names versus category labels influence the neuronal representations of objects as individuals or categorical members.</p>
