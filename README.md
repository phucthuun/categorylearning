## PROPER NAME VS. CATEGORY LABELS and their influence on conceptual representations 


<b>This work aims to provide a neurocomputational account for semantic formation and concept learning by training a neurobiologically realistic deep neural network to learn 30 instances from 10 categories, then conducting a subsequent test to assess its performance on categorization, generalization, and the neuronal representations for category-critical versus instance-specific features.</b>

Cell assemblies (CAs) (Braitenberg, 1978) refer to sets of neurons that become highly responsive to conceptually related and repeatedly presented stimuli as a consequence of correlational learning mechanisms. When neurons in the neural network are consistently coactivated and become strongly connected, they form CAs and represent semantic features of a concept. To facilitate readersâ€™ understanding about the results of the CA analyses in my master's thesis, I offer in the EXPLORE section an interactive illustration of the CAs emerging in the network model after training. This web application allows readers to explore - on a neuronal representational level - the differential impacts of category labels versus proper names on encoding and storing category-critical and instance-specific features of within-category and across-category instances.
